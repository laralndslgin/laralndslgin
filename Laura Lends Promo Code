With a presidential election that ended in a never-before seen way, it is almost impossible to focus on the underlying issues. However, the outcome of these issues represent state by state decisions that will ultimately affect thousands of Americans. Payday loan initiatives appear quite frequently on election ballots due to their strong controversial nature. Although debates and proposals have been given and displayed time and time again to help people understand the importance of the payday loan industry in America, it remains a negative part of our society.

What is the controversy? Simply put, payday loans are illegal in 15 states nationwide and it seems that many more states are following suit. While the majority of people say it is just another money hungry industry looking to trick consumers into paying unnecessary amounts of money, some people have come to understand the purpose of the lending business. Regrettably, the opposing side is composed of people who do not need and have never used the system and more unfortunately still, they are the vast majority of people who actually vote on these issues. Because most payday loan institutions are centered in low-income areas of the country, many view them as illegitimate businesses. The truth is they are there because they are needed. Most low-income consumers depend on payday loans to pay off their pending bills or simply to make ends meet on a day-to-day basis.
